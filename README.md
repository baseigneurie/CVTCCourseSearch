# CVTCCourseSearch
A front-end application I developed for CVTC that searches available courses based on the school term.

All sensitive information has been replaced with "XXXXXXX".

This project is built with the Vue.js framework. Front end styling is created by Bootstrap and Skeleton.css.

Packaged with Webpack for deployment.
